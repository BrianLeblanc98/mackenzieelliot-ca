This site is to keep track of how many times my friend, Mackenzie Elliot, has lost the game. I've created a site with a simple display of how many times he has lost the game, and a button to add to that count. However, we have a 30 minute grace period for The Game, so the button will be disabled and change to show a countdown until the grace period is over. The date and time of each button press is stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.
